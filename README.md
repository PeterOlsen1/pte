# THE PTE.

The PTE is a simple text editing program I made in rust, just as a hobby project.
It is by no means a *polished* text editor, and it is basically just the result of me toying around.

TODO:
* Figure out suitable keybinds
* Tabbing (writing \t didn't work?) (see about auto tabbing length (check line above))
* Selection (SHIFT + DIRECTION would be nice, CTRL + SHIFT for line select in that direction?)
* Copy + Paste
* Finding substring (CTRL + F)
* CTRL + Delete (remove whole line)
* More editor tabs?
